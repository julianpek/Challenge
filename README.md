## About the Project

The goal of this project was to create a customer list prototype that is easily editible by the user. One key feature included in the project is form and input validation. Through styling changes, error notifications, and restrictions, the user is guided for every step of the editing process to ensure a smooth experience. A GET request is used to fetch customer data through a RESTful API. Depending on the outcome of the GET request, different information is displayed to provide a better user experience. If the the GET request fails, the user is notified through an error message. While the request is in progress, the user is notified through a loading message. Finally, if the request is successful, the user is presented with their customer data mapped inside a table with the ability to edit each customer.
